# Broken Keyboard

Suppose you wrote `happy birthday` in your old keyboard and you saw that in your screen it showed `hawwy birthday`. It seems that some keys are not working well, right? Write a function that receives the original string and the output of the malfunctioning keyboard and return the broken key(s).

You should write the code inside the curly braces, where it says `Your amazing code here`.

## Examples

```javascript
findBrokenKeys("happy birthday", "hawwy birthday") âžž ["p"]

findBrokenKeys("starry night", "starrq light") âžž ["y", "n"]

findBrokenKeys("beethoven", "affthoif5") âžž ["b", "e", "v", "n"]

```

## Local Test

For testing your code you must run: 

```sh
npm install

npm run test

```

## Notes:

- You can read the test files, so you can have an idea of what is the expected result, but **do not edit them** please.

- **Extra points** if you don't use `for` in your solution.
